# QUESTION 1:
# What type of floating point error has been introduced?

# ANSWER 1:
# **For a general matrix the floating point errors could be representation error (e.g. the subtraction
factor when we divide by the pivot value), rounding error (e.g. the row reduction operations), and
error accumulation (e.g. the repeated row reductions). The floating point error that we observe
in test2.txt is mainly error due to machine precision.**

# QUESTION 2:
# How did this occur?

# ANSWER 2:
# **Floating point numbers are represented with a significand multiplied by a base to an exponent. This 
means that there are limitations to how precise numbers can be represented, and resulting in the machine 
precision error that is occuring in test2.txt without partial pivoting. 

When we do addition and subtraction of two floating point numbers they both have to be stored with the 
same base and exponent of the larger number. From this we can deduce that the machine precision error occured 
during the last row reduction calculation (100^10+1), where 1 cannot be precisely represented with the 
same exponent as the larger value of 100^10, so it is represented as a 0. When we add these two values together 
we get 100^10 rather than 100^10+1. For 100^10, there is a value that exists where any number less than this 
value will exhibit this property of machine precision error. This value will is defined as computer zero**


# QUESTION 3:
# How does partial pivoting address this issue?

# ANSWER 3:
# **Partial pivoting addresses the machine precision error by simply ensuring that the pivot value before each
iteration of row reduction is the largest, which ensures that the subtraction factor for each row is always less
than or equal to one. We want each iteration of row reduction to use a small subtraction factor such that the 
other coefficients of the row does not get larger after every iteration; otherwise, we would run into machine 
precision error similar to test2.txt. This type of error would likely occur in very large n*n matricies where 
the subtraction factor for every iteration of row reduction is also very large. 

While we can eliminate the machine precision error with partial pivoting, other errors are still present such as 
rounding and representation error of numbers. However, the rate of increase in these types of error would be 
much lower than that of errors induced by the absense of partial pivoting.**
